HINTS ΤΟ STUDENTS· XV.

rney heve elepeed sinoe the original entry wss mede, the index
serves seithfhlly es e gnido when the memory would heve
utterly failed. But to neglect the entry et the time of reading
isto fell beck on the memory, end usually to forget

Besides e method of aequiring references, there is eregu·
lerplen to be followed, which rendere writing ensier to the
student. Few themes occur which do not require, in some
portione, eithere regularityol alphabeticel or numericel order.
The subject mey he a history, en index to ο hook, e chromo·
logicel table, or references ιο authors who heve written on the
subject, end to whom we tum in their order. If for en index
ιο ο hook, the student will proceed es follows :—Usethepeper
on which yon write on one eide only, end proeeed to put down
the subjecte es they occur.

Welklnp, rute of, ln dltl'erent untione, 1.
Indlen, klndncss of en, 2.

When the whole book is gone through, end the index is

eompleted, cut the peper into slips, end errenge the subjecte
in elphnheticel order; the index mey then he neetly copied
end etteehed to the book. We mey thus form e chronological
teble of history es nn outline of ο work; or errenge e pile of
references, each of whioh will ιο uppermost Just es we went
it; end we mey very the order of arrangement et pleesure.
Slips thus prepnred may he posted in order on sheets of
waste pepcr, they ere then reedier for use end less likely to
ιο lost. lf intended to ιο printed, they must elweys be posted
on convenient-sired sheets, to serve ns copy for the compo-
sitor.

In writing for the press, itis e good plen to write only on
one side of the peper, es the copy cen then ιο given to two
or more compositore to set, which otherwise cennot be die-
tributed, end therefore cerrees deley. But e more importent
reeson to the miletis, thet he mey require to elter e portion
of his work, hy re-writing some perte end adding to othere.
lfhe desires to remove or ulter ο portion of the writing the
beck of whioh ie blenk, it oen he done et once, the whole pes·
sege mey then ιο re-written end inserted3 but if the pepcr is
written pn both sides, the lebour of correctionis greatly
mcreese .

In writing out extreote, references, end remerkehle pes·
